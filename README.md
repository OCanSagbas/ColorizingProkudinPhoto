# ColorizingProkudinPhoto

Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii (1863-1944), a Russian chemist and photographer, is considered as a pioneer in color photography. With Tsarâ€™s special permission and funding, he traveled across the Russian Empire, and took color photographs of people, daily life, buildings, landscapes, etc., documenting the early 20th-century Russia. He produced these color photographs by using a simple but ingenious idea: recording three exposures of every scene onto a glass plate using a blue, a green, and a red filter. These negative plates is now in possession by the Library of Congress of U.S.A., and have been recently digitized.

The goal of this assignment is to automatically produce color images from the digitized Prokudin-Gorskii glass plate
images by applying some simple image processing techniques. For that, you will need to extract the red/green/blue
color channels from the digitized plate images, and find the best alignment so that they form an RGB color image
with few visual artifacts.
